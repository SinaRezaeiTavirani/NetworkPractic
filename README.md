# TCP Server with Multi-Client Support using Boost Asio

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a TCP server with multi-client support, built using Boost Asio. The server is designed with an object-oriented approach, allowing it to handle multiple client connections concurrently.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Modular code structure for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Multi-Client Support:** Asynchronous I/O operations enable handling multiple clients concurrently.
- **Boost Asio Integration:** Utilizes Boost Asio for robust networking and asynchronous communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler:** A modern C++ compiler (C++11 or later).
- **Boost Library:** Ensure that Boost Asio is installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SinaRezaeiTavirani/NetworkPractic.git
2. Build the projects in visual studio (in the near future I will make a cmake so it would be much easier).
3. first run the exampleserver.exe and then exampleclient.exe
4. you can test server and client connection with '1' key and '2'
